# Transform Game

## Introduction

**Transform Game** is a two-player Python-based game that merges fun with learning through Linear Algebra concepts. Players navigate objects in two 2D planes: an original and a transformed (skewed) version. The game uses matrix transformations and vector operations to detect collisions, offering an engaging problem-solving experience.

## Features

- **Collision Detection**: Identifies intersections between objects on both planes.
- **Linear Transformations**: Skewed world based on matrix transformations.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Increasing complexity as players progress.
- **Interactive Physics**: Inspired by billiard mechanics for realistic interactions.

## How to Play

- Use keyboard controls to move your objects.
- Avoid collisions while navigating through dynamic game levels.
- Interact with evolving game elements and transformations to progress.
